# RTU-Fan-Analysis
Data analysis of rooftop unit fan performance and compressor cycling trends

## About

This repository contains the planning and analysis logic for evaluating rooftop unit (RTU) fan behavior and compressor cycling patterns. It supports a phased data analysis workflow.

Raw sensor data is NOT stored here due to size and privacy constraints. Cleaned summaries and charts are available in the `outputs/` directory.
